First test error messages in ASP.
Check for SQL injection with "1=1" and "=" in all text boxes
Make sure inputs are protected against XSS attacks
	-test that malicious inputs are blocked


I haven't been able to test this properly yet. I need to take some time out to review
what is actually going on here still. I think I implemented it properly in PHP but
I've had some issues with ASP. I will certainly be rewatching more class videos this
week and taking some time during the day off.
